    Bend Builders is an informal group of web developers, designers and all those in-between who:<br>
    <ol>
    	<li>Are based in Bend, OR (or want to get plugged in to the community here)</li>
    	<li>Are working on building a startup, side project, or other entrepreneurial venture</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
  	Our group is virtual and centered around a HipChat room. We do occasionally get together in person, but mostly last minute and always using the @all feature in HipChat (e.g. "Hey @all, I'm down at Deschutes hacking away on Meteor. Come on down if you're free.")
  </p>
  <p>
  	To get the HipChat invite link, simply sign in with GitHub.<br>
